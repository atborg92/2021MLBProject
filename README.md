# PortfolioProject

The purpose of this project, first and foremost, is to showcase my SQL accumen to potential employers. As an ardent baseball fan, last season's MLB stats seemed like a natural starting point. Data was sourced from stathead.com, a paid subscription service that offers downloadable sports statistics. Though limited by stathead's restrictions on how many rows can be exported at once (only 300), I exported a multitude of CSV files relating to the 2021 MLB season. These included team overall stats, individual player stats, and per-game data for my favorite team, the San Francisco Giants. These tables were then imported into MySQL WorkBench 8.0 for data cleanup and exploration.
